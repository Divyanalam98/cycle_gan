CycleGAN is a cutting-edge deep learning framework for unpaired image-to-image translation. 
It effortlessly converts images of apples into oranges and vice versa. By leveraging cycle consistency loss, the model learns domain-specific features while maintaining image authenticity. 
Its potential applications include data augmentation, style transfer, and more. CycleGAN's creative transformations open new possibilities in art, design, and agricultural research, revolutionizing computer vision capabilities.
